# ChuckBot




Hi,
This is the Chuck Norris Telegram bot.
To contact with it, you just need to set a language, for example: "set language en" (to set the language to English).
Then, when it responds "No problem" (or in the language that you picked), you can enter a number between 1-101.
The bot will respond with a joke about Chuck Norris.

So to summrize:
1. set the language by - "set language en" or to other language
2. enter a number between 1-101.
3. wait for the joke.

Here are some expamples:
